中国政府针对手机、平板与智能手表等数码产品的购新补贴于1月20日全面上线。外界普遍认为，这一举措排除了苹果等部分高阶机型，但因国产品牌多位于该价格区间，料将成为此次补贴的主要受益者。专家分析指出，年初祭出补贴虽能刺激短期销量，却难以拉动全年整体销售表现。

根据中国商务部实施的《手机、平板、智能手表购新补贴》规定，凡购买人民币6000元（约820美元）以下之产品，可享有15%的补贴，最高补贴额为500元。在此政策影响下，各厂商纷纷调价以符合补贴门槛，将多款手机售价下调至至5999元。例如苹果的iPhone16 Plus 128G自6999元直降千元，小米14 Ultra 12+ 256G自",中国推手机购新补贴6000元限额激活国产品牌 苹果面临压力

1. In TDM while respawning this message show eveytime , Like eveytime I die it pops up 
2. The game is choppy , like I have good internet and it shows normal ping still the character is stuck reloading, unable to switch weapons etc 
3. After respawning the loadout doesn't load , and the scope is removed while showing that it's attached to thr weapon 
Overall the game's so buggy I can't play ","Installed BGMI, too buggy to play"

I just had my Galaxy A35 repaired, the exterior glass on the rear camera. It was done in about 20-25 minutes. My friend says it wouldn't be possible to properly glue everything back together with all the waterproof thingies installed correctly in that amount of time. ",Was i scammed?
