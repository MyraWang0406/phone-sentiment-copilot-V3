一直是iPhone用户，因为讨厌刘海，五年半前曾经买过没有刘海和挖孔的红米K30 Pro，刷了MIUI global版服役至今，当备用机。

由于对性价比印象不错，最近它电池鼓胀，加上补贴，从国内两千七买了第二台小米手机——小米14，512+16，比iPhone是实惠相当多的（我非常讨厌iPhone的灵动屎，因为做热点时截屏有疤，非常挫的设计）

iPhone 17用日本eSIM，小米14插中国手机卡收验证码。

体验了一两个月我给小米14解锁，刷global版。

然后发现不像5年前那样，官网申请就能解锁了，需要去它的狗屁小米社区坚持签到发帖升级到LV6，然后答题等智障操作。总之，对一位正常人来说，不可能浪费时间泡它那个弱智的论坛。

推测随着管控的收紧，今天的大陆安卓手机的情况大同小异，供各位参考。",五年前和今天的小米手机

中国政府针对手机、平板与智能手表等数码产品的购新补贴于1月20日全面上线。外界普遍认为，这一举措排除了苹果等部分高阶机型，但因国产品牌多位于该价格区间，料将成为此次补贴的主要受益者。专家分析指出，年初祭出补贴虽能刺激短期销量，却难以拉动全年整体销售表现。

根据中国商务部实施的《手机、平板、智能手表购新补贴》规定，凡购买人民币6000元（约820美元）以下之产品，可享有15%的补贴，最高补贴额为500元。在此政策影响下，各厂商纷纷调价以符合补贴门槛，将多款手机售价下调至至5999元。例如苹果的iPhone16 Plus 128G自6999元直降千元，小米14 Ultra 12+ 256G自",中国推手机购新补贴6000元限额激活国产品牌 苹果面临压力

Any tips or methods to get it to connect would be great. I dont want to do the whole return process for it. ",Wearos on chinese rom

Hi everyone. This question has been bugging me. One of the reasons people bought snapdragon products was availability of custom roms. Now that bootloader won't be so easily unlocked does this mean mediatek chips can be considered as well? Eg poco f5 vs poco x6 pro (redmi k70e). Once you're on Hyperos then basically it's just chip performance and not just what we can do with flashing etc. 

Any thoughts on this?",Now that Hyper OS is here and bootloader is almost impossible to unlock does this mean end of custom roms?

# 当走上“金牌个人”领奖台时，我仿佛真的成了“港剧女主角”

杨玉梅 [心声社区](javascript:void(0);) *2025年11月10日 19:31* *广东*

**当我成了“港剧女主角”**

**文/杨玉梅**

小时候看港剧，我最迷恋那些穿西装踩高跟鞋的女强人。她们走路带风，穿梭在高楼大厦间，在职场叱咤风云。我就默默地想：长大了，我也要成为这样又飒又厉害的都市丽人！

带着这份对职场的浪漫想象，我加入了华为，负责手机订单端到端交付，保障工厂产出手机，按时、保质地交付给客户。

入职前，我兴冲冲买了好几套“白领战袍”和化妆品，想象自己每天光鲜亮丽去上班。结果呢？在紧张的工作节奏里，我每天睁眼就在“打仗”：随手抓件衣服套上，胡乱抹两下防晒，抓起电脑就往公司冲。什么精致白领？能按时打卡就不错了！还没等我穿上“战袍”化身都市丽人，就成了同事口中那个凌晨三点还在办公室跨时区开会、黑灯瞎火中差点把同事吓破胆的“拼命三娘”。

从职场小白到 “拼命三娘”，我越来越清晰地意识到：真正的“飒”，不是穿什么，而是你在工作中能不能扛得住事、打得了硬仗。

Hi guys, I recently broke my OPPO Reno 12 5G. The screen and LCD are cracked and now there’s black leakage on the side. I checked around Cavite for shops that have the screen/LCD part but none had stock.

So I’m planning to buy the screen + LCD online and just have the labour done at a nearby shop. But I’m worried about the legitimacy of the part (on Shopee) and whether the shipping/packaging will keep the part safe.

Hi I'm a Vivo X100 user in the UK and I'm likely to switch my phone.

I'm considering the Oppo Find X8 Pro,  the OnePlus 13 or the Find X9 Pro. 

My current Vivo X100 overheats like crazy sometimes and is Chinese ROM, which may be why I don't get work email/whatsapp/other important notifications and some 5G bands might be missing.

I'm also worried about warranty/insurance/support and I'm an O2 carrier. Vivo has no stores here and neither does Oppo and OnePlus but O2, Carphone Warehouse, Currys,",Best UK choice

Hi everyone,

I recently bought a x100 Ultra and have been in the process of setting it up. One thing I've noticed is the homepage is dull when compared to the lockscreen. I checked to see if the dim wallpaper option is selected and it's not. Would anyone have any idea on why this is the case?

Hey everyone,

 I wanted to share something really strange I witnessed recently.

On 05-04-2025, around 10:15pm , I saw a set of circular lights moving in the sky above Dindigul, Tamilnadu, India. The lights were rotating in a weird pattern – not like drones or planes – and it went on for a few minutes before disappearing.

I managed to record the event on my VIVO Y200 smartphone, and the footage is untouched but just muted and also there were no noise or any sound caused by that phenomenon. The","Captures Strange Circle Lights in the Sky- Dindigul, Tamilnadu, India."

1. I have been using vivo y11 since 2019 and it's been an absolute menace. I'm a clumsy asf person but this phone survived multiple impact falls, even a screen panel change with no issues whatsoever. Battery performance is still 10/10 even when the charger isn't original (I lost mine). Obviously it lags by now but overall- it's manageable I LOVE MY PHONE PLS.

Hey folks,
I’ve been seeing a lot of posts like “OriginOS 6 has bugs, battery drain, UI glitches, calls not working, animations lagging” etc.

Just wanted to share my experience because it’s been the complete opposite for me.

Device: iQOO 12 (I2220)

Updated to: OriginOS 6

What I did after updating: Factory reset

Result: Zero bugs. Zero glitches. No battery drain, no overheating, no app crashes, no animation stutters, nothing.

I still remember my dad stressing over bills, my mom quietly saving every rupee, and me watching all of it — promising myself that one day, things would change.
That one day, we wouldn’t just survive, we’d live.

Fast forward to today...

Hey r/dji,

I'm looking to buy my first drone purely for fun—think casual flying around the neighborhood, maybe some quick aerial shots for social media, nothing professional. I've got a Galaxy S24 Ultra, so I'm fine using my phone as the screen if the controller doesn't have one built-in.
I've narrowed it down to these four options on Amazon Mexico (prices in MXN):

DJI Flip (Control Remoto con Pantalla RC 2) - $13,999

DJI Flip (basic, no screen on controller, 4K UHD camera) - $8,540

On paper, the Poco F8 Ultra absolutely destroys the S24U in AnTuTu scores, but I honestly don’t know how much that score really matters in real-world emulator gaming. I’ve always kind of seen Poco as more of a mid-range/low-range brand, and the display quality also ",S24 Ultra for Emulator gaming.

Hey everyone,
Just switched to the Pixel 10 Pro from an S24 Ultra, and I’m honestly loving the experience so far. The software feels clean and smooth, but there’s one thing that’s really standing out — font inconsistency.

The system font looks great in the UI, but many apps (like ChatGPT , YouTube and WhatsApp) don’t seem to adopt it. Instead, they use a completely different font, which makes the overall experience feel a bit uneven. iOS has unified typography everywhere, so this contrast is no",Anyone else noticing inconsistent fonts across apps on the Pixel 10 Pro?

- International warranty that’s valid in Germany  
- Full LTE/5G support (including rural bands like B20 &amp; B28)

And for the input I'm using my haute42 hit-box updated to the latest version of the GP2040CE firmware so i can count on either the screen or the led changing colour to start counting frames from. 

  
My issue i",Android Handheld Latency

Almost each loading, the game crash. No matter how low or high the graphics, or switching container settings, still crashes mid-loading.

If the game successfully ran without crashes, I was only lucky. Like 1/10000000 lucky.

Tbh i don't know who to blame. The game or my phone?

Please suggest me phones which would have a better hardware than the A35 and also has good camera hardware (RAW support needed). I dont want to buy the A56 as i dont see a lot off difference. The S",Need suggestions for new smartphone

My MIL asked for my help picking a new smartphone. We have a great relationship (which, from what I’ve read, seems rare these days!), and I want to make sure I get it right.

I don't know why this is so difficult.. you would think I should know by now. The last phone I got, a Nord +1 something or other seemed to have comparable specs to the Samsung Galaxy I had prior to that but the camera sucks. 

  
Basically I just want a phone, preferably a Samsung, that can take decent pictures and has a good amount of storage. Also I use Mint Mobile... 

and I don't want to pay more than $500

📢 Open Letter to Samsung: Treat A-Series Users Fairly With Updates

Dear Samsung,

I am a proud Galaxy A-series user, but I need to say this honestly: your update policy is unfair.

One UI 7 (Android 15) was released in September 2024.

Galaxy S23 users got it in December 2024.

I, with my Galaxy A35 5G, had to wait until May 21, 2025.
That’s 8 months later for the exact same software.

I have a Galaxy A35 and ever since the last Samsung update the camera looks completely different. The beautify filter used to make me look like myself but just a little smoother and more flattering. Now it makes my skin look 20 years older, my eyebrows look fake, my eyes look smaller with weird eyeliner, and overall it makes me look unnatural and unappealing.

This is not my phone hardware because it worked fine before the update. I even spent hours on Samsung chat support and all they did was ",Why did Samsung ruin the beautify filter after the last update?

We take a Galaxy A35 to change the display because the display was broken after a fall.

After the reparation it began to freeze a few times a week. We went to the reparation center and they cannot catch the problem. They offered to change the display again but we don't know what to do.

What could be happen?

The mobile gaming market is probably the one that makes the most money for the gaming industry, and Warzone Mobile managed to be a disaster precisely on mobile. 

Warzone mobile has great gameplay, mechanics, and missions during the Moro BR multiplayer and resurgence, but what destroyed the game was definitely the optimization.
