Worth the 550€.","zeko, 25 Jul 2025how is it?1 Month with it, No issues at all 🙂‍↔️ the phone is just wow , picture quality is amazing, really fast, display is great , os is really smooth, great animations, but it lacks customization. All of the issues people told me about cn rom (Chinese everywhere, notifications don't  get delivered, etc....)I have none. Don't get me on the fast charging , after only 11minutes it charges from 26%to100% , battery is good , could be better but don't mind, lasts like 13hours of everyday activity (gaming,social media , and camera) but overall . Great phone. Worth the 550€.",2025-12-06T12:19:07

Issues I faced:
 
1. Overheating Problems:
 
The phone becomes uncomfortably hot while watching offline videos.
 
Using Wi-Fi to browse YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram also causes it to heat up, making the experience unpleasant.
 
The phone gets even hotter while charging.


 
2. Performance Issues:
 
The device occasionally hangs, which is frustrating for everyday tasks.


 
3. Processor Credibility:
 
There is no official information about the Snapdragon 6s Gen 1 processor from Qualcomm. This raises serious doubts about what kind of processor has actually been used in this phone.


 
4. Camera Quality:
 
The main camera is 13 MP, and the front camera is 5 MP. The photo quality is subpar and far below expectations.



 
My Opinion:
 
Purchasing this phone has been a deeply disappointing experience. Releasing a product with misleading information about its components and performance feels like a disservice to customers. In my view, proper research should be done before buying such devices.
 
Advice: 
I strongly recommend that anyone considering this phone or similar products should thoroughly check reviews and ensure they are confident about the processor and camera performance before making a purchase.","I recently purchased the Oppo A3 smartphone, which claims to feature the Snapdragon 6s Gen 1 processor.

in the start, i can say this is one of the trashiest phone in this price range
 
build: the back is glass so it's good, tbh no one cares about this one since everyone uses the case...
 
display: this is just an AMOLED panel, nothing special here, mind you **NOTHING SPECIAL HERE ONLY**, it doesn't have Dolby vision, hdr, etc stuff that are you can easily get in other phones in this price (x5 pro), thumbs down...
 
performance: in this price, this has one of the choppiest performance even when compared to its predecessor, it sucks, the 4 gen 1 is one main reason why this is phone sucks, thumbs down...
 
cameras: it's impressive, or atleast at photography...both front and back doing their job perfect until when it comes to videography, because of the mf'ing 4 gen 1, it's capped down to 1080p@30 on both...WtF!!!!!! camera too doesn't do a good job full-fledged-ly...
 
conclusion: guys... forget about this phone like it didn't exist, if you want a Vivo phone with the same price, much much much better option is Vivo T2 Pro...Thank you!","as my classmate brought it on december 1st, here's our review for anyone who's looking for this phone:
