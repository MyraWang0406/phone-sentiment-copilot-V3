There isn’t any super major customization like android but the closest you can get at the moment is misaka26. Do not update your phone past iOS 26.1 for now if you want to customize.

They run in a process the developer doesn’t control and apple really doesn’t want it updated more frequently than 10-15 minutes. They try to push you into developing timelines of data states that apple’s OS can render in sequence which doesn’t really work well for this use case. Not surprised it would have some issues.

Make sure you get bright, color temperature tunable lights. The imaging sensor on your phone is necessarily tiny tiny tiny.
